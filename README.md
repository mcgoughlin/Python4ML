# Python4ML
Hello!

This short course introduces Python and Machine learning at a beginner's level.

This course was developed to train clinicians and biomedical scientists at Cancer Research UK's Cambridge institute how to develop machine learning models in the shortest possible time.

We hope these materials provide utility for a broader audience! We suggest reading through the lecture slides before proceeding to the tutorial sheets. All the data needed for this short course can be found in the 'sample_data' subfolder in each week's folder.

If you have any questions on this course's content, or how to get started on this course, email me at wcm23@cam.ac.uk.

Best of luck on your learning journey!

Bill, Ines and Hannah
