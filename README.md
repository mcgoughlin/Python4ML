# Python4ML Introduction
### Hello!

#### This short course introduces Python and Machine learning at a beginner's level.

The course was developed to train doctors and biomedical scientists at Cancer Research UK's Cambridge Institute to develop machine learning models in the shortest possible time.

**Download the course's content by clicking the green 'code' button and hitting 'Download .zip'.** Once downloaded, unzip the folder structure on your computer. The lecture slides will be viewable offline within this folder structure, but you will still need an online connection to access the tutorials.

**The tutorials can be accessed using the following links:**

Create a copy of these tutorials in your own Google Drive to run the code. To do this, go into the tutorial link, click 'File', and finally 'Save a Copy in Drive'.

We hope these materials provide utility for a broader audience! Although the tutorials are completely self-contained - you do not *need* any external material to understand the tutorials - we
suggest reading through the lecture slides before proceeding to the tutorial sheets. **All the data needed for this short course can be found in the 'sample_data' subfolder off each week's folder, and will be downloaded automatically along with the code and lecture slides upon clicking 'Download .zip'.**

If you have any questions on this course's content, or how to get started on this course, email me at wcm23@cam.ac.uk.

Best of luck on your learning journey!
