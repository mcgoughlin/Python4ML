# Python4ML
This short course introduces Python and Machine learning at a beginner's level.

## Introducing the course - put these statements into an introductory video.

The minimum requirement for this course is having completed high-school mathematics.

All concepts explained apply to every machine learning algorithm, from the most basic linear regression to the most advanced AI computer vision classifier.

We are not interested in reinofrcment learning in this course.

"Algorithm" and "model" are used interchangeably in this course, but they are strictly different things. An AI algorithm is the process that *creates* the AI model.
